Identify patterns in historical maintenance logs
Optimize PM intervals to avoid reactive maintenance
Provide visual oversight into equipment health and maintenance cycles

## 🧰 Approach
Queried historical logs using SQL to detect repeated failures and maintenance gaps
Segmented assets based on criticality and failure rate
Built a Power BI dashboard to visualize equipment-wise PM frequency and impact
Used Excel for scenario modeling of downtime vs cost

## 🎯 Results
Reduced unplanned downtime by over 50 hours per month
Improved PM coverage for high-risk equipment
Gave managers a real-time tool to track asset health and service status

## 👩‍💻 My Role
Wrote advanced SQL queries to extract actionable insights
Designed and deployed the Power BI dashboard
Coordinated with maintenance teams to validate and refine scheduling rules
